BOOSTER: BOOtstrap Support by TransfER: 
BOOSTER is an alternative method to compute bootstrap branch supports 
in large trees. It uses transfer distance between bipartitions, instead
of perfect match.

   This function precomputes the esperence of the expected number of parsimony steps

   In Input:
   - The max depth
   - The number of taxa
   - A pointer to a 2D array (given by precompute_steps_probability(int max_depth, int nb_tax)):
      * First dimension : depth
      * Second dimension : steps
      * value : probability of the step at a given depth
   In output : An array with :
   - the depth in index
   - the expected Number of random parsimony steps
